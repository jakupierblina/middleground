              <p> Middle Ground as the name has the right point meaning! We just want to be a stand point or area midway between extreeme or opposing positions. <br><br>
                  With this project we just want to help others "struggling" understanding the concept for developing and building softwares in simple and clean code.
                  <br>By making youtube videos, sharing projects code in different platforms we think we can help each other grow and become efficent not just monkey coding.
                  You can follow us in any social platform or write us a direct email at middlegroundinf@gmail.com.
                We look forward hearing from you :)
