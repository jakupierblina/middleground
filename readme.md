# About Middle Ground



Middle ground as the name has the right point meaning!

I just want to be a stand point or area midway between extreme or opposing positions.

With this project I just want to help others "struggling" understanding the concept for developing and building software's in simple and clean code. By making YouTube videos, sharing projects code and different platforms we think we can help each other grow and become efficient not just monkey coding.



You can follow in YouTube social platform or write a direct email at middlegroundinf@gmail.com

Looking forward hearing from you :)
